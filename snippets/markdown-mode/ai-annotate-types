Given the following context:
\`\`\`

\`\`\`

Then, update the following proposition so that type names reference the matching type
definition using \`[[ref:<uuid> …]\` where \`uuid\` is the uuid that identifies the
matching type. Do not repeat references, for instance it is sufficient to annotate
the type name String only once. Note that the name of the type being defined should
not be annotated with a reference, since we are defining it in its very proposition
headline.
